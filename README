+# Task Manager Web App
 
+This repository contains a simple task manager that stores its data on the server so you can access it from any device. The application uses a small Node.js backend that saves data to `data.json` and serves the web interface from the `public/` directory.
+
+## Usage
+
+1. Install dependencies:
+
+```bash
+npm install
+```
+
+2. Start the server:
+
+```bash
+npm start
+```
+
+3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
+
+All tasks and projects are saved in `data.json` on the server, so you can host the server anywhere to keep your data accessible online.
